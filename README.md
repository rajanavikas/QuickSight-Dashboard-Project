# Amazon QuickSight Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to visualize a dataset using Amazon QuickSight, AWS's data visualization service. The dataset used here is based on Netflix titles, showcasing how to upload data to an S3 bucket, connect it to QuickSight, and create insightful visualizations.

## Game Plan
### ü™£ Upload Dataset to S3:
- Store dataset files (netflix_titles.csv and manifest.json) in an S3 bucket.

### üÜï Create Amazon QuickSight Account:
- Register for a QuickSight account, which is free to set up.
- Enable QuickSight's access to your S3 bucket where the dataset resides.

### üîó Connect Dataset to Amazon QuickSight:
- Link the dataset in the S3 bucket to QuickSight using the manifest.json file's URI.

### üìä Create Visualizations:
- Utilize QuickSight to generate various graphs and charts from the dataset.
- Example: Visualize the number of movies released each year categorized by type (movie or TV show).

### üèÜ Publish Dashboard:
- Compile all visualizations into a cohesive dashboard.
- Export the dashboard as PDF for sharing and documentation purposes.

## Steps Completed
### Upload Project Files into S3
The dataset (netflix_titles.csv) and its metadata (manifest.json) were uploaded to an S3 bucket. The manifest.json file was edited to ensure it points correctly to the dataset's URI within the bucket.

### Create QuickSight Account
A QuickSight account was created without any cost. Setup took less than 5 minutes, and access to the S3 bucket was configured to facilitate dataset visualization.

### Connect S3 QuickSight
The dataset in the S3 bucket was connected to QuickSight by providing the URI from the manifest.json file. This step ensures QuickSight can locate and interpret the data for visualization.

### Make Visualizations
Using QuickSight's AutoGraph feature, visualizations such as charts depicting the number of movies released each year by type (movie or TV show) were created. Filters were applied to focus on specific years and genres, enhancing data analysis.
